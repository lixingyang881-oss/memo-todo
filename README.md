This update focuses on smoother transitions, refined visual polish, and improved code organization.

## ✨ 1. NEW — iOS-Style "Jelly Bounce" Animation (Main Input Card)

- The memo input panel now performs a soft **elastic bounce** animation after saving.  
- Implemented using a refined **cubic-bezier curve** for a native iOS-like feel.  
- Fixed an issue where the card shifted horizontally — it now stays perfectly centered.

## ✨ 2. NEW — Playing-Card Style Insertion Animation (Memo Fan)

- New memos animate **from the center**, rotating into position like a card trick.  
- Smooth transition path: **scale → rotate → settle**.  
- Slight appearance delay avoids abrupt jumps and creates a dynamic fan effect.

- Deleting a memo triggers a **breaking / dissolving** visual effect.  
- Offers clearer user feedback.

- Important cards remain correctly aligned within the fan layout.
